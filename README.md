# Linux-Live-Wallpaper
My wallpapers on Linux (KDE 5) using extension that shows HTML page as wallpaper
# Videos
In the same directory as html page I have 15 files (.mp4) containing my wallpapers. Files are named py pattern CHARACTER_**D**AY/**N**IGHT_LOCATION.mp4
I cannot share files on GitHub (they are too large and I'm not owner of their content, but let's imagine there are cute anime girls in repository)
